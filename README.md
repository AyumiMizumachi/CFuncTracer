# CFuncTracer
c function tracer with ctags.

## motivation
I wanna get function call-tree. (callee/caller tree).  
  
In almost case, I think, call-tree can be made by doxygen/graphviz.  
and these are graphical and useful.  
  
In other case, some people use share ware / proprietary software  
to get more detail trees.  

But, I don't have a lot of money.  
so, I decided to make "function tracer".  

## the characters

### ctags

ctags can make lists of symbols by c source or header files.

### python

my favorite language.

### c sources / headers

input files.
